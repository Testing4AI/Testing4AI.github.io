I"{<p>One paper entitled <em>Attack as Defense: Characterizing Adversarial Examples using Robustness</em> is accepted by ISSTA 2021.</p>

<p>This work proposes to use ensembled attack strategies to defense adversarial examples (potentially from adaptive attacks) based on the robustness difference between benign and adversarial examples.</p>

<p>Preprint and code coming soon.</p>
