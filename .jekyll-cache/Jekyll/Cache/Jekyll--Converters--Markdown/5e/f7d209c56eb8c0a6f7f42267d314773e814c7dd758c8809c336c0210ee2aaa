I"Å<p>One paper entitled <em>Towards Interpreting Recurrent Neural Network through Probabilistic Abstraction</em> is accepted by ASE 2020.</p>

<p>This work bridges the gap between black-box recurrent neural networks (RNN) and model-based analysis approaches by automatically extracting more tracable, reasonable and transparent models, i.e., probabilistic finite automata, from RNN.</p>
