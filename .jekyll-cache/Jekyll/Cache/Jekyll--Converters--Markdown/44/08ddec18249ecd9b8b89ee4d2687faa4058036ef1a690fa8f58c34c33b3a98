<h4 id="research-interest">Research Interest</h4>

<p>In general, my research concerns <em>how to better design, implement and analyze systems, with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) systems and cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as autonomous driving car, industrial control system, and recommendation system, using various software engineering (SE) techniques ranging from formal methods, program analysis to software testing.</em> Most of my recent works are focused on testing and enhancing the robustness or fairness of deep learning models deployed in different application domains.</p>
