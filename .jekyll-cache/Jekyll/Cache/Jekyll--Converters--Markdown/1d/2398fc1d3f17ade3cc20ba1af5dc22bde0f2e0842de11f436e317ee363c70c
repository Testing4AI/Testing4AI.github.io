  <li>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05793.pdf">ICSE 2019</a>] Proposed a runtime detection system framework to filter adversarial samples of deep neural networks. Compared to prior detection algorithms, it is sufficiently efficient to be applicable at runtime.</li>

  <li>[ASE 2020] Proposed to interprete recurrent neural networks by extracting more tracable, reasonable and transparent models, i.e., probabilistic finite automata. The extracted models can potentially bridge the gap between black-box neural networks and existing model-based analysis methods like testing/attack/adversary detection, predictive analysis and runtime monitoring.</li>

    <p>[ICECCS 2020] Conducted an empirical study on the correlation between coverage and robustness for deep neural networks, which is surpringly limited.</p>
