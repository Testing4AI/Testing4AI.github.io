One paper entitled *Copy, Right? A Testing Framework for Copyright Protection of Deep Learning Models* is accepted by IEEE S&P 2022. Congrats to Jialuo and all co-authors. 

This work proposes a generic testing framework to judge model theft behaviours like model fine-tuning, pruning and extraction by proposing a set of indicator metrics and corresponding test case generation methods.
