One paper entitled *Improving Neural Network Verification through Spurious Region Guided Refinement* is accepted by TACAS 2021. 

This work proposes a spurious region guided refinement framework for over-approximation based neural network verification approaches to improve their precision.

Preprint and code coming soon.
