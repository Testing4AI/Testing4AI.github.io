Our paper *Adversarial Sample Detection for Deep Neural Networks through Model Mutation Testing* is accepted by ICSE 2019. [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05793)] 

This work utilized the distinguishable sensitivity between adversarial and benign samples of a deep neural network to detect adversarial ones.
