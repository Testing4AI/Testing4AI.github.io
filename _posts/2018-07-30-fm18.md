I attended FLOC 2018 at Oxford, UK and presented our work *Towards ‘Verifying’ a Water Treatment System* at FM. [[slide](https://github.com/wang-jingyi/myslides/tree/master/FM18)] 

This work presented a case study to formally modeling and verifying the [SWaT](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/testbeds/secure-water-treatment-swat/) system at SUTD using probabilistic learning.
