Our paper *Automatically ‘Verifying’ Discrete-Time Complex Systems through Learning, Abstraction and Refinement* is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE). [[early access](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8576657)] This work proposed a CEGAR-based learning approach to automatically verify a complex system from its traces.
